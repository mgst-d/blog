hey guys a serious talk today well i mean not really but sort of
so learning language is hard learning
anything isn't the easiest thing and
people always search for easy ways and
shortcuts and it's natural when it comes
to learning a language we also want to
find the fastest and easiest but most
effective ways to learn a language so i
was scrolling through youtube videos
recently and i came across this video
that was titled learn english in your
sleep and it was like eight hours long
i understood that it was meant to be
played overnight during sleep
i didn't watch it because i immediately
thought to myself
yeah right this is so stupid are people
actually falling for this
and then i saw how many views it had and
what was mind-blowing to me was that it
had millions of views i was stunned
you know i could have said that there is
no harm in trying this out you know like
do whatever works for you however
not only does it not work but i actually
think that it's well
not harmful but deceptive and
distracting and you can say or think
whatever you want that i'm just jealous
that there's millions of views on that
video
but i'm speaking from the perspective of
a language learner who has tried a
million of different ways methods and
techniques to learn english because i
was in your shoes and i guess still am
and i think i know a thing or two about
learning a language but i didn't just
come here empty-handed let's take a look
at what science says according to the
life science.com website
absorbing complex information or picking
up a new skill from scratch by say
listening to an audio recording during
sleep is almost certainly impossible
but research shows that the sleeping
brain is far from idle and that some
forms of learning can happen however
whether that's worth losing sleep over
has yet to be determined over the years
scientists and researchers conducted
many experiments because this idea of
learning something new during sleep
sounded groundbreaking however the most
successful experiment was in the area of
breaking the old ones and forming new
habits multiple studies have found that
a basic form of learning called
conditioning can happen during sleep and
2012 study published in the journal
nature neuroscience for example israeli
researchers found that people can learn
to associate sounds with odors during
sleep the scientists played a tone to
sleeping participants while unleashing a nasty spoiled fish smell
once awake upon hearing the tone the
people held their breath in anticipation
of a bad smell although the memory was
implicit it could affect the people's
behavior researchers found in 2014 study
published in the journal of neuroscience
in that research smokers used fewer
cigarettes after spending a night being
exposed to the smell of cigarettes
paired with rotten eggs and spoiled fish
now let's talk about what studies have
found about learning languages during
sleep in their 2017 study published in
the journal nature communication
subjects were able to pick out complex
sound patterns that they had heard
during sleep
learning abilities in sleep may extend
to the learning of words in a study
published in the journal current biology
in january researchers played pairs of
made-up words and their supposed
meanings like that guga means elephant
to sleeping participants after this went
away the people performed better when
they had to pick the right translation
of made-up words in a multi-choice test
what all these studies have in common is
that they show an implicit form of
memory
it's not some knowledge they will be
able to use spontaneously because they
don't know this knowledge is even there
learning a new language involves many
different layers recognizing the sounds
learning the vocabulary and mastering
the grammar
so far research suggests it may be
possible to get familiarized with the
tone and accent of a language or even
the meaning of words while sleeping but
to a weaker level than what we already
do all the time during the day without
noticing
and then you have to consider the cost
stimulating the sleeping brain with new
information likely disrupts the
functions of sleep negatively affecting
the pruning and strengthening of what we
have learned over the previous day
while losing quality sleep to
potentially learn a few words is not a
smart trade-off researchers continue to
study sleep learning because the
compromise may be worth it in special
cases for example sleep learning could
be useful when people need to change a
habit or alter stubborn disturbing
memories in cases of phobias or
post-traumatic stress disorders noise
affects and disrupts our sleep and
shattering is also noise your brain
registers those sounds and this won't
let it calm down plus when there is a
change in sound like for example someone
starting to speak louder it might even
wake you up even a couple of times a
night nighttime noise may also cause
05:31
extra production of hormones such as
05:33
adrenaline and cortisol as well as
05:36
elevated heart rate and blood pressure
05:38
the next day after such a not really
05:41
satisfying night's sleep you are more
05:43
likely to feel irritable tired of course
05:46
you are more likely to underperform and
05:49
those are just short-term facts but
05:51
there are also long-term effects of such
05:53
sleeping patterns
05:55
one of which is bad memory and this is
05:57
not what we want when we're learning a
05:59
language a good night's sleep on the
06:01
other hand has incredible positive
06:04
effects on our health and memory
06:06
the healthy sleep website says
06:09
sleep learning and memory are complex
06:11
phenomena that are not entirely
06:13
understood
06:15
however animal and human studies suggest
06:17
that quantity and quality of sleep have
06:20
a profound impact on learning and memory
06:23
research suggests that sleep helps
06:26
learning and memory in two distinct ways
06:29
first a sleep-deprived person cannot
06:32
focus attention optimally and therefore
06:35
cannot learn efficiently
06:37
second sleep itself has a role in the
06:40
consolidation of memory which is
06:43
essential for learning new information
06:45
so it might be even harmful after all
06:49
just think of all those times when you
06:51
fell asleep watching a movie did you
06:53
remember it when you woke up did you
06:55
remember any dialogues
06:56
if learning new information in our sleep
06:59
was possible we would all be brainiacs
07:01
right now so you'd better start
07:03
implementing a healthy sleeping routine
07:06
to help your brain learn better when
07:08
you're awake
07:09
just don't waste your time and don't
07:11
waste your precious night's sleep and
07:13
jeopardize your health in your learning
07:15
ability
07:16
having said that to each its own do you
07:19
know this phrase
07:20
this means that we're all different we
07:22
have different tastes and points of view
07:25
i'm not an exception so even if i don't
07:28
agree with someone or don't like
07:30
something or someone else doesn't agree
07:32
with something you agree with
07:34
it might still work for some people
07:37
you know i always try to keep an open
07:39
mind and always say that anything is
07:42
possible however i don't think that
07:45
after listening to a recording in your
07:47
sleep
07:48
you'll wake up the next morning and be
07:50
able to speak another language i can't
07:52
even imagine how frustrating it must be
07:54
to wake up in the morning and still
07:57
wouldn't be able to speak english and
07:59
wouldn't be fluent in english but if you
08:02
are one of those people who has learned
08:04
a new language by listening to audio
08:06
recordings in your sleep then i think
08:08
that you should apply this ability of
08:10
yours and take part in some studies
08:14
and get recognition
08:16
maybe studies in your brain will give
08:18
scientists some answers and serve as a
08:20
breakthrough in the scientific world and
08:23
just as a bonus tip
08:25
it's not that it's ridiculous it's just
08:28
that it's counterproductive
08:30
don't bother learning a certain amount
08:33
of words per day
08:35
knowing two three four thousand words in
08:38
english does not equal fluency you might
08:41
know 2 000 words in english and their
08:44
translation to your native language
08:46
because this is how we usually learn
08:48
words in a foreign language by
08:50
translating them but yet you might not
08:53
be able to speak that language i get
08:56
this question almost every day how many
08:59
words per day should i learn and i
09:01
wouldn't focus on learning a certain
09:03
number of words per day but rather on
09:06
speaking on learning to speak english
09:09
and on pronunciation
09:11
and let
09:13
new vocabulary be a byproduct of that
09:16
learn new words as you go with the
09:18
correct pronunciation and in the context
09:22
i had a whole conversation about this
09:24
with my american accent coach john if
09:26
you're interested the link will be in
09:28
the description okay guys that's gonna
09:30
do it for this video go take a good nap
09:32
and learn while you're awake improve
09:34
yourself until the next one
